# CMSC-325-Project-2
#### Introduces the use of BufferedImage in the Java2D API

Creates an Animation JPanel that contains multiple images. Images are then transformed depending on the frame of the Animation panel.

_Note: The "CMSC325Week4Templates" folder contains the java files I was supplied to be used as a template. The result being the "Java2D_Animation" project. Additionally, this program is an almost identical copy of "CMSC-405-Project-1". However, this is what was assigned for the class._
