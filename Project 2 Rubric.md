<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>In this homework you will develop a Java 2D graphics application that creates 5 images. The images should have the following specifications:<br>a. Size: minimum 25x25 pixels, larger images are Okay<br>b. Type: Color (consists of two or more colors)<br>c. Simple form or shape (Hint: consider a letter or number, or even simple shapes such as crossing lines, rectangles, or circles<br>d. You should generate the image inside of separate methods and store them as 2D arrays.<br>2. Use Java 2D graphics to display your original images.<br>3. For each image use the existing Java 2D graphics transformation methods to translate, rotate and scale each object. You should perform the following transformations on each image:<br>a. Translate -10 in x direction, Translate +12 in the y direction.<br>b. Rotate 55 degrees counter clockwise.<br>c. Rotate 75 clockwise<br>d. Scale 3 times for the x component, scale 1.5 times for the y component<br>e. Each of these transformations should be displayed in sequence with the images always starting from the previous transformation as opposed to the original image.<br>f. Use Java 2D graphics to display each transformation for each image. (Hint: ruse the Week4Zip&nbsp; Java code for a good start for this assignment.)</p>
<p>You should submit your code along with a Word (or PDF) file describing your project and demonstrating successful testing of all functionality through labeled and described screen captures.</p>
<p>Grading Rubric:</p>
<p>1. All images and functionality present and working properly. (8 points)</p>
<p>2. Documentation includes descriptions of the application along with detailed screen captures showing and describing all results of the working application. (2 points)</p>
